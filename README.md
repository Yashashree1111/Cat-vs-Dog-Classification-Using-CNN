# Cat-vs-Dog-Classification-Using-CNN
Cat vs Dog Classification project powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), developed using Keras, TensorFlow, and Streamlit

rerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- TensorFlow (2.x)
- Keras (2.x)
- Streamlit

- To start the Streamlit app, run the following command:
- $ streamlit run app.py

- This will launch a local server and open the app in your default web browser.

### Uploading Images

Once the app is running, you can use the interface to upload images of cats and dogs. Click the "Browse" button to select an image from your computer, and then click the "Classify" button to see the model's prediction.

## Model

The classification model in this project is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a powerful architecture for image classification tasks. The model has been trained on a dataset of cat and dog images to learn the distinguishing features between the two classes.
